## Step 5: Get Your Public Key

1. Go to "Account" in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Find your **Public Key** (e.g., "user_abc123xyz")
3. Note this down

## Step 6: Update the Website Code

In your `index-complete.html` file, replace these placeholders:

1. **Line ~1752:** Replace `"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"` with your actual public key
2. **Line ~1889:** Replace `"YOUR_SERVICE_ID"` with your Gmail service ID
3. **Line ~1889:** Replace `"YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID"` with your contact form template ID
4. **Line ~1925:** Replace `"YOUR_AUTOREPLY_TEMPLATE_ID"` with your auto-reply template ID

Example:
```javascript
// Replace this:
emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");

// With this (using your actual key):
emailjs.init("user_abc123xyz");
```

## Step 7: Test the Setup

1. Upload your updated `index-complete.html` to your web server
2. Fill out the contact form on your website
3. Check your Gmail inbox for the message
4. Check if the user receives an auto-reply (if enabled)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"EmailJS is not defined" error:**
   - Make sure the EmailJS script is loading properly
   - Check your internet connection

2. **"Service not found" error:**
   - Verify your Service ID is correct
   - Make sure the Gmail service is properly connected

3. **"Template not found" error:**
   - Check your Template ID matches exactly
   - Ensure the template is published (not in draft)

4. **Emails not arriving:**
   - Check your Gmail spam folder
   - Verify the template variables match the code
   - Check EmailJS dashboard for error logs
